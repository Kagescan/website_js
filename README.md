# Kagescan.fr (v2) source code

The Kagescan project is first and foremost a website born from a well-defined philosophy. However, the project has gradually lost its mentality and since 2019, there has been no real development activity.

A total redesign of the site is therefore planned for the 5 years of the project (February 14, 2020) with the following objectives:

- A minimal but very fast website (effort to make as few requests as possible at the client level, SPA or serverless concepts are counterexamples)
- A low cost deployable php website (suitable for a free shared hosting), maintainable by small groups of fans
- Tools to create, organize and publish translations of all kinds (manga pages as well as light novel texts)
- More recently, a will to respect privacy (going beyond a legal site by using as few cookies as possible and not relying on third party tools such as AddThis or Google Analytics) and the ability to localize the website's content

Currently, we are doing some upstream work for the realization of this new project, including self-training to make a rigorously stable and secure site.
